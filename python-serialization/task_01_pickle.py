"""
Module for serializing and deserializing custom Python objects using pickle.

This module defines the CustomObject class which supports serialization to
a file and deserialization from a file, with proper exception handling for
file-related errors.

    A custom object class representing a person with attributes name, age,

            Class method that deserializes and returns an instance from

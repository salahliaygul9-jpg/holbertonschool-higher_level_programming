geometry.py

Module providing a base class and a derived class for geometry operations.

This module defines two classes:
- BaseGeometry: A base class with interface methods for geometry operations.
- Rectangle: A subclass of BaseGeometry that represents a rectangle.

Classes:
    BaseGeometry
    Rectangle
